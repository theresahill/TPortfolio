    <h4>The Project</h4> 
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>For this project, I developed a functional portfolio website for a young photographer. The owner, Patrick Hill, had a large collection of images that he wanted to be able to share online. The purpose of the site was to show off his work while providing for the possibility that he could later turn this page into an online store.</p>

    <h5>Style Tiles</h5>

  </div>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>Patrick did not have a well-developed brand, so I started by working with him to develop one, and establish the way it would look and feel. Confident that his brand was as he envisioned, we then went through a series of questions to help clarify his preferences for his website. These ended up being extremely helpful, as he surprised me several times in his answers and in the styles and objects he gave as examples for his inspiration. I used his responses to narrow down colors and styles, and he selected his favorite from three Style Tile options. With these in mind, we had a clear sense of how the page would continue to develop.</p>

    <h5>Logo Design</h5>

  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>Because we had taken the time to really establish and create a clear look for his brand, we also took the opportunity to revise the signaure/logo that he had been using. I only had a short amount of time to design the logo and create an image that would reflect his interests and the focus of the page. The logo that we ended up using depicts a camera lens shutter in the shape of a wave, perfectly reflecting Patrick's love for surfing and photography.</p>

      <p>Based on the photographs provided by the client, I divided the work into three categories: land, sea, and portraits. The photographs are displayed to receive the maximum real estate on each page.</p>

    <h5>Developing the Page</h5>

      <p>Knowing that he would be sharing the page for networking and marketing purposes, it was important that the page would be coded responsively so he could share his work wherever he was. For ease of use when scrolling on smaller devices, the images will scroll vertically, and will scroll horizontally while on desktop.</p>

    <h4>Recap</h4> 
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths"> 
      <p>I found that the biggest challenge for this page was to balance the request of the client to keep the page extremely simple, but still make it visually interesting. It was important to make sure the design of the the page plays a supporting role, while allowing the photographs to be the star of the show. Because he is a young photographer who is still developing his career, it was exciting to work with him to really think through the business aspects of developing a brand and the ways that this website could be used to help him now and in the future.</p>
