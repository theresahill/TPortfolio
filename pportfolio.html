      <p>For this project, my assignment was to develop a portfolio website for a young photographer. The owner, Patrick Hill, had a large collection of images that he wanted to be able to share online. He is not quite ready to commit to making an online shop and, because photography is still a hobby, he isn't interested in offering his services on commission. Because of these wishes, I wanted the page to be clean and simple, with his photographs as the main focal points.</p>

      <p>Patrick didn't have any strong vision of how he wanted the site to look, so we had to do some work to make sure that our exectations for the page were the same. I went through a series of questions to help clarify his preferences. These ended up being extremely helpful, as he surprised me several times in his answers and in the styles and objects he gave as examples for his inspiration. I used his responses to narrow down colors and styles, and he selected his favorite from three Style Tile options. From here, we were able to move forward with the project confident that we were on the same page.</p>

      <p>While he had not explicity mentioned that he was looking for a new logo, I felt that the signaure/logo that he had been using in the past was a bit too simple to use for the website, and gave myself a short amount of time to try to develop something that would work better. The logo that we ended up using was actually developed quite quickly and, by depicting a camera lens shutter in the shape of a wave, perfectly reflects Patrick's love for surfing and photography.</p>

      <p>Based on the photographs provided by the client, I divided the work into three categories: land, sea, and portraits. The photographs receive the maximum real estate on each page. The page is coded responsively so, for ease of use, the images scroll horizontally on larger screens and vertically on smaller screens. The final step in this project was to launch it on Github.

      <p>I found that the biggest challenge for this page was to balance the request of the client to keep the page extremely simple, but still make it visually interesting. It was important to make sure the design of the the page plays a supporting role, while allowing the photographs to be the star of the show.</p>
