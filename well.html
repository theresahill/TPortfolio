    <h4>The Project</h4>

      <p>WELL is tackling the chronic disease epidemic by addressing the workflow challenges of the allied health industry. It is a HIPAA-compliant messaging platform that handles all the business of a small practice. The free software helps providers manage their practice and get paid by insurance. My task was to create a marketing page that was addressed to the allied health providers, clearly expained the product and benefits (in layman terms), and was made to convert users to request a demo.</p>

      <p>My brief included a company background, target audience, product benefits, and key sections that I needed to include in the website. The color palette and logo were established, and I was also given several "inspiration" sites that they liked. Because I was unfamiliar with how other similar companies were approaching their websites, I did a fair amount of research to see how other companies presented their healthcare solutions. For WELL, I knew that pricing (FREE!) would be a huge selling point for many of the providers, so I wanted to have this take a priority placement on the page. For the rest of the information, I took the approach of arranging the sections in terms of General to Specific in terms of information. Earlier sections would have general overviews about the product, and the user could get more and more detailed information and they continued to scroll. I wanted a button that would take them to a sign-up area to be readily available whenever someone was ready to sign-up. With these in mind, I created and presented three wireframe options for the website.</p>

  <h5>Hi-Res Mock-up</h5>

  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>After the options were narrowed down to one wireframe, I began the hi-res mockup. At this point, I was provided with initial drafts of the copy for each section, which was extremey helpful when developing the hi-res version. With real text, it was much easier to check that my designs would work with the text that they had in mind for each section. I created and presented a desktop and mobile version to get early feedback. They requested to see a couple options for one section, and a few other small changes on others. After I showed them mock-ups of the options they requested, they chose their favorite and I was able to complete the high-res mockups and show how it would look on various devices.</p>

    <h4>Recap</h4>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths"> 
      <p>I was thrilled to work with this startup, and really be the first to help them think through and plan their marketing page and future look and feel of their website. As someone who is, personally, very interested in health and wellness, I also really enjoyed working on a product that I think will really be so helpful and beneficial for allied health providers. In doing my research for this project I also loved getting a better understanding for what other companies are doing in this space, and am excited to see the ways that tech and healthcare continue intersect in the future.</p>
