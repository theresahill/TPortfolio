      <p>Paycrave was also a project that I completed during my Bloc program. This consumer mobile app  allows users to discover nearby food trucks, and also select and purchase food items. As part of the requirements, users also needed to be able to view previous transactions, and provide feedback for each food truck they purchased from. To get me started, I was provided with a style guide (which I later revised) and logo.</p>

      <p>The development of user personas helped to clarify the needs of the app users and to better determine what the flow should look and feel like. I was provided with five user stories to start to understand the customer:</p>
      <ul class="text_list">
          <li>As a user, I want to view food trucks near me on a map</li>
          <li>As a user, I want to select a truck, view details, and see a menu</li>
          <li>As a user, I want to create an account and view recent transactions</li>
          <li>As a user, I want to choose items to purchase and pa for them using my phone</li>
          <li>As a user, I want to rate and review a food truck, and view other ratings and reviews</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>Using these stories and combining them with the personas that I developed, I determined that the typical Paycrave user would most likely be an urban professional interested in quickly finding and ordering food over their lunch break. This would mean that timesaving features (like seeing the distance to trucks, and the ability to save payment information) would be important elements to help minimize the time required to place and order.</p>

      <p>Comparing trucks and menus meant that the user would not have an exactly straightforward flow. The user might go back and forth between several screens before making a decision. To combat any confusion as to where the user is in the program, I had initially intended to have all truck and menu information slide up from the bottom of the screen, while the ‘home’ map would always be visible in the background. This was later scrapped during design refinement as it didn’t provide enough room to comfortably display information and, ultimately, the continual movement of screens up and down would have been too visually disruptive in practice.</p>

      <p>One of the more challenging user flow sequences was for payment. My first flow (seen above) felt too complicated, and the several steps would (most likely) be frustrating for the users. I revised this sequence several times, each time trying to reduce the user actions, and make the checkout process more streamlined and clear. The final version (seen below) reduces the order review, tipping, and payment process (assuming the user has saved payment options) into two simple steps.</p>

      <p>The hi-res mockup of the app (seen above) was created in Sketch. It was a this point that I abandoned the initial color palette (the provided colors were darker red, a red-orange color, green, and black) in favor of a more playful palette that still utilizes appetite-stimulating hues.</p>
      <p>User testing in InVision revealed a few places in the checkout process where things could be further clarified. It also showed the instances where  the navigation was confusing or where there was more information than was required to complete each action. With this information, I changed a few of the icons, increased text size and, once again, revised the check-out process.</p>
