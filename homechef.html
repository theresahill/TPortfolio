    <h4>The Project</h4> 
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
    <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>I worked with home-delivery food company HomeChef on a short six week consulting project focused solely on their landing page. The objective was to assess the page and make recommendations to improve the overall design to increase conversion. It was important that this iteration was not meant to be a rebranding and that they wanted to stay fairly consistent to the overall look and feel of the page; our goals included optimizing partial placement, call to actions, copy, images, and colors. </p>

    <h5>Assessment</h5> 
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
    <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>The first step was to do a complete assessment of the page “As Is.” Each section was evaluated for readability, imagery, and messaging. The order of the sections were also assessed as a whole, and I suggested a slight reorder so that the “skimmability” and “story” of the page was most effective from top to bottom. One thing that was agreed upon early on was that the “hero” image at top of the homepage would be changed to better reflect the product. </p>
      <p>Because HomeChef does not yet deliver nationwide (though they are growing quickly), I was  particularly interested in how this information was best conveyed to users. The current solution requested that the user input both their zip code an email. My concerns were: a) Would a tentative user balk at having to put in their email? b) Would a user NOT in the service area want to know immediately? Or would they be annoyed if they got to the checkout before they found this out? c) This information is still useful for determining future markets. Could we find a way to follow up with them later? I did research into how several other companies approached this problem and, in my report, discussed these findings along with pros and cons for a few options. While we were focused on the A/B testing discussed below, it was decided that this would be a great test for a later date. </p>
      <p>A separate assessment was done for the mobile responsive version of HomeChef. The mobile version provided other unique insights into ways that the design could be improved and adjusted to help clarity for mobile users. </p>

    <h5>A/B Testing</h5> 
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
    <div class="grid__item push--one--one-eighth one--six-eighths">
        <img class="show" src="Images/homechefwireframes.jpg">
      </div>  
  </div>
   
  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths">
      <p>Done concurrently with the overall section assessment, I created four different A/B tests to run on the landing page “above the fold.” All of these projects were aimed at capturing and focusing the attention of the user during the critical first moments on the page. My initial assessment of the page showed several instances with conflicting actions, or spaces where the “way forward” isn’t totally clear (specifically, these are places where buttons or links with the same goal take the user to different places). </p>
      <p>The goal of the A/B Testing experiments was to reduce these instances of potential user confusion, and visually streamline the options for the user to encourage movement down the sign-up funnel.</p>
      <p>I created and mocked up four A/B tests. They were:</p>
      <ul class="text_list">
        <li>Moving the sign-up box above the fold</li>
        <li>Changing the priority of the text buttons and leaving only the main 'Get Started' button orange</li>
        <li>Removing the 'Learn More' button</li>
        <li>Reducing the size of the hero image so that the viewer would automatically see the top of the second section</li>
      </ul>
      <p>HomeChef opted to go with the first three tests and implemented them right away. After twenty days, the results of the homepage showed that the current page still had the best layout. This outcome was helpful because it meant that the placement of the call to action buttons and the sign-up box were not creating any friction with users, and HomeChef is now able to move onto other tests, like switching out the hero image. It also indicates that more work and testing are needed on the sign-up funnel.</p>

    <h4>Recap</h4> 
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths"> 
      <p>Working with HomeChef on this short project was an interesting experience. I had anticipated that at least one of the tests would be a clear winner so, while I was a little disappointed that the original homepage had the best outcome, it really reinforced the importance of testing everything. Taking an in-depth look at all sections of the page was a good reminder that, when designing a page, attention should be paid to how the individual sections impact the view of the whole page. I found that on this page, it felt like many of the sections were arranged without much consideration on how their placement impacted the ones on either side of them. Simply changing them around could affect the users feeling impression of the information and trust for the whole product. </p>
