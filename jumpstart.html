      <p>As another project for my Bloc program, the design direction for JumpStart was completely up to me, but I was again provided with several user stories to guide the project and focus on the two user groups - fundraisers and donors. The user stories are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="text_list">
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to create and account</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to display my progress of reaching my monthly and annual goals</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to view a list of people who donated and how much they gave</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to monitor comments on my fundraiser page</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to sign up for an account</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to browse local charities that I can donate to</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to donate</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to track my donations</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>Using the user stories, I worked through all the possible actions of fundraisers and donors to develop a user flow.</p>

      <p>The user flows helped to clarify the variety of actions that a user could take on the site, from both the donor and the fundraiser perspectives, and perhaps even as both. It was important to design the page so that it was equally friendly to project creators as well as donors, and I initally struggled a little to not skew things too much towards donors. Around this time, I decided that I wanted the focus of the site to be for community-oriented crowdfunding projects. Working with this concept in mind helped me to manage the scope of the site and give the project more of a direction and purpose.</p>

      <p>While the landing page, and project pages deveopled fairly quickly and smoothly, the account and project set-up pages took a fair amount of reworking before I settled on a layout that felt like it workd. My initial plan was to have each part of the account sections (ex. donation, comments, account, profile, etc.) be an individual page. Users would have a links bar under the page header that would take them to each of these pages. The idea was that keeping each page simple and separate would help avoid confusion and reduce the amount of information on each screen to keep things clear. In reality, the pages ended up looking too empty. By combining a few of the sections onto a main page, while still keeping the main account pages on their own screens, I felt like I had more success in balancing the visual and functional components of the account screens. </p>

      <p>As so much of the imagery for the site would be contributed by users, I was challenged to think of the "worse case scenario" when designing and planning for the imagery. This meant considering what both horizontal and vertical images would look like if they were uploaded onto the site. Both options are tested in the mockup.</p>

      <p>Overall, I enjoyed the complexity of this project. However, one struggle that I had throughout the design and mock-up was with the typography. Because of the variety of information that I was trying to present, I found that I ended up working with too many styles and the page looked visually confusing and wasn't quite cohesive. It took much longer than expected to fix these problems and find a solution that worked.</p>
