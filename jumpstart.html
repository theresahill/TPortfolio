      <p>JumpStart is a conceptual web application for people to crowdfund donations for charities and foundations that is similar in intent to existing sites like Kickstarter, JustGiving, and GiveForward.</p>

      <p>The design and feel of the project was left entirely open ended. However, as this was a project for my Bloc program, I was provided with several user stories. Focusing on the two user groups - fundraisers and donors - the user stories are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="text_list">
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to create and account</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to display my progress of reaching my monthly and annual goals</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to view a list of people who donated and how much they gave</li>
          <li>As a fundraiser, I want to monitor comments on my fundraiser page</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to sign up for an account</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to browse local charities that I can donate to</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to donate</li>
          <li>As a donor, I want to track my donations</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>As I developed the user flow, I found the donor side of the page to be pretty straight-forward. It was very important for me to also keep the account pages as simple as possible. Would every campaign require a new account? Could a user be both a donor and an account owner? In the end, I decided that I could organize the account page so that a user could see any campaign they started as well as all of their donations. By grouping several account information boxes on one screen, a user could see all of their activity on the site in a single glance.</p>

      <p>It was important to design the page so that it was equally friendly to project creators as well as donors, and I initally struggled a little to not skew things too much towards donors. During this stage in the development, I decided that I wanted the focus of the site to be for community-oriented crowdfunding projects. Working with this concept in mind helped me to manage the scope of the site and give the project more of a direction and purpose.</p>

      <p>While the landing page, and project pages developed fairly quickly and smoothly, the account and project set-up pages took a fair amount of reworking before I settled on a layout that felt like it worked. My initial plan was to have each part of the account sections (ex. donation, comments, account, profile, etc.) be an individual page. Users would have a navigation bar under the page header that would take them to each of these pages. The idea was that keeping each page simple and separate would help avoid confusion and reduce the amount of information on each screen to keep things clear. Because I didn't have much content to use, I decided during the mock-up process to combine several sections onto a main page. This allowed me to combine all the information that a user might want to use in one central location without spreading onto unnecesary pages and forcing the user to take extra clicks to find what they need.</p>

      <p>As so much of the imagery for the site would be contributed by users, I was challenged to think of the 'worst case scenario' when designing and planning for the imagery. This meant considering what both horizontal and vertical images would look like if they were uploaded onto the site. Both options are included in the mockup.</p>

    <h4>Recap</h4>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths"> 
      <p>Overall, I enjoyed the complexity of this project. I particularly enjoyed thinking about how to create a framework that would end up being populated with user-supplied information. It was an interesting challenge, knowing that a charity owner might not use an ideally oriented or scaled image, or want to incorporate the amount of information I provided for. One struggle that I had throughout the design and mock-up was with the typography. Because of the variety of information that I was trying to present, I found that I ended up working with too many styles and the page looked visually confusing and wasn't quite cohesive.</p>
