      <p>The design of the Jott.ly homepage was a project I completed during my Bloc program. Jott.ly is a web-based platform targeted towards groups that have the need to remotely collaborate on projects. Specifically, they are targeting creative industries with a focus on groups that work with editorials and internet publishing. As a competitor of Evernote, Google docs, and Draft, its differentiating features include real-time collaborative writing and editing with multiple users, notation ability (where users can leave “notes” at specific places in the document, but also view them all in one central location, Voice Conferencing Ability to talk with fellow collaborators, and the ability to bring together a variety of sources (websites, PDF documents/scans, etc.).</p>

      <p>I was provided with guidelines that indicated that the site should feel friendly and professional but not “chummy.” The site should come across as professional, and show that the company is interested in providing a well-designed solution. Determining the color palette and designing the logo were the first steps in developing the brand. To emphasise the calm that can result from the ease of use of the project while still maintaining professionality, I chose a color palette a teal, whites, and a complimentary highlight of marigold. For the logo I worked to find a design that was not too literal but also reinforced the collaborative nature of the product. The multi-page flip does just this while also suggesting the shape of the ‘J.’</p>

      <p>Because this was for this to be a “first-glance” marketing page for potential users, it was important to answer the who, what, and why for the page and to make signup easy and immediately available for potential users. I also wanted to emphasize the differentiating product features, and provide user testimonials as further ‘proof’ of the product quality. 
      After working out the details for this page in Balsamiq, I developed the hi-res mock up in Photoshop, and then finally coded and launched the page on github. To see this final version, follow this link.</p>

      <p>The was the first page that I designed and coded so, throughout the process, I was very conscious of designing something that would be within my coding skill abilites. Also, because this was completed during a rapidly paced program, I made some “best at the time” decisions that I wonder if I would have made if I had had more time. While there are a few areas that I would still adjust, I’m proud with how this first project turned out.</p>
