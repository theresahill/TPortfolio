      <p>Jott.ly is a concept marketing page I developed from a creative brief I was provided during my Bloc program. Conceived as a web-based platform, it is targeted towards groups that have the need to remotely collaborate on projects; specifically, creative industries,  and groups that work with editorials and internet publishing.</p>
      <p> As a competitor of Evernote, Google docs, and Draft, its differentiating features include real-time collaborative writing and editing with multiple users, notation ability (where users can leave notes at specific places in the document, but also view them all in one central location), voice conferencing ability to talk with fellow collaborators, and the ability to bring together a variety of sources (websites, PDF documents/scans, etc).</p>

      <p>I was provided with guidelines that the site should feel friendly and professional but not 'chummy.'' When developing the color palette, it was important for me use the colors to emphasize the calm that can result from the ease-of-use of the product. As 'professionalism' can sometimes come across as stark and lifeless, I was also focused on selecting colors that would be inviting. I chose a palette of teal, whites, and a complimentary highlight of marigold.</p>
      <p>I worked through a wide variety of designs to develop the logo, focusing on the showing the collaborative nature of the product. I also wanted to incorporate a suggestion of the 'J' from Jott.ly, but keep it less obvious. The final design of a multi-page flip nicely combined both of these goals.</p>

      <p>Because this was intended to be a 'first-glance' marketing page for potential users, it was important to answer the who, what, and why for the page, and to make signup easy and immediately available. I first sketched several versions of the layout to test a few layout ideas. From there, I mocked-up my favorite version in Balsamiq. A hi-res mock up was created in Photoshop, and then I coded and launched the page on github.</p>

  <div class="grid grid--full">
  <div class="grid__item push--one--one-sixth one--four-sixths"> 
      <p>The was the first page that I designed and coded so, throughout the design process, I was very conscious of developing something that would be within my coding abilites. Also, because this was completed during a rapidly paced program, I made some 'best at the time' decisions that I wonder if I would have made if I had had more time. While there are a few areas that I would still adjust, I’m proud with how this first project turned out.</p>
